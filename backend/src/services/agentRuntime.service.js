/**
 * Assemble the provider-facing prompt: static instructions, the KB, the prior

 *
 * THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE KB CACHEABLE, so the ordering is load-bearing.
 * Measured against the live API (backend/scratch/probe_gemini_cache4.mjs and
 * 5.mjs) on gemini-2.5-flash and gemini-3.1-flash-lite:
 *   1. A KB sitting in the system instruction is NEVER cached — 0%, every turn.
 *      Implicit caching only ever matched a prefix of contents[].
 *   2. Appending the transcript (or a per-turn affect line) to the system prompt
 *      drops the hit rate to 0% even when the KB is in contents[].
 * Hence: the system prompt must be STATIC per agent, the KB must be the first
 * conversation turn, and anything varying per turn must come after both.
 * Measured result: 87-88% of prompt tokens cached from turn 2 on, ~73% fewer
 * full-price tokens per call.
 *
 * The same rule binds anything added later — per-contact campaign variables,
 * A/B prompt tweaks, time-of-day greetings. Put them in `lastContent`, never in
 * the system prompt, or every agent's hit rate goes back to zero.
 *
 * Providers without structured history (custom endpoints, mock) keep the old
 * transcript-in-system-prompt shape: they gain no caching, but they must not
 * silently lose conversation memory.
 *
 * Pure and exported so these invariants are testable without a DB or network.
