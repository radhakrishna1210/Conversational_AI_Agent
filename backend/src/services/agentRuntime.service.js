/**
 * Assemble the provider-facing prompt: static instructions, the KB, the prior
 * turns and the current message.
 *
 * THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE KB CACHEABLE, so the ordering is load-bearing.
 * Measured against the live API (backend/scratch/probe_gemini_cache4.mjs and
 * 5.mjs) on gemini-2.5-flash and gemini-3.1-flash-lite:
 *   1. A KB sitting in the system instruction is NEVER cached — 0%, every turn.
 *      Implicit caching only ever matched a prefix of contents[].
 *   2. Appending the transcript (or a per-turn affect line) to the system prompt
 *      drops the hit rate to 0% even when the KB is in contents[].
 * Hence: the system prompt must be STATIC per agent, the KB must be the first
 * conversation turn, and anything varying per turn must come after both.
 * Measured result: 87-88% of prompt tokens cached from turn 2 on, ~73% fewer
 * full-price tokens per call.
 *
 * The same rule binds anything added later — per-contact campaign variables,
 * A/B prompt tweaks, time-of-day greetings. Put them in `lastContent`, never in
 * the system prompt, or every agent's hit rate goes back to zero.
 *
 * Providers without structured history (custom endpoints, mock) keep the old
 * transcript-in-system-prompt shape: they gain no caching, but they must not
 * silently lose conversation memory.
 *
 * Pure and exported so these invariants are testable without a DB or network.

  //    the whole reply. Safe here because ElevenLabs Flash is consistent
  //    per-request (unlike Sarvam's stochastic streaming TTS, which drifted in
  //    voice/pace when synthesized sentence-by-sentence).
  //  • SINGLE-CALL (Sarvam / others, or LLM-spike fallback): one converse() + one
  //    TTS call — one generation, consistent voice, no LLM overlap.
  //
  // Both cap the LLM's occasional latency spikes (gemini-3.1-flash-lite usually
  // ~1.5-2.3s but sometimes stalls 8-13s — see logs/latency.log): a timeout
  // falls back to a fresh attempt. Two thresholds because they measure
  // different things: the overlap path races the FIRST TOKEN (healthy: Groq
  // <1s, Gemini <1.5s → 2.5s catches spikes early), the single-call path races
  // the WHOLE reply (healthy Gemini runs up to ~3s → needs the 4s headroom so
  // normal turns never pay a wasted retry).
  // When to give up waiting for the primary stream's first token and hedge with
  // a second one. It has to sit ABOVE the normal first-token time or every turn
  // pays for two generations, and BELOW the point where the caller decides the
  // line is dead.
  //
  // 1500ms was set on the belief that gemini-3.5-flash-lite's whole first-token
  // distribution was 1.0-1.2s. Measured against 28 real turns in
  // logs/latency.log (2026-08-28) it is not: p50 1686ms, p90 4199ms. The
  // threshold was sitting BELOW the median, so the "hedge" was firing on more
  // than half of all turns — a second full generation as the normal path, not
  // the exception. On free-tier Gemini (15 rpm) that doubles the request rate
  // that causes the 429s converseStream then has to route around.
  //
  // 2500ms sits between that p50 and p90: genuine stalls are still caught, a
  // merely-late token is not. It is also clear of Groq, whose measured first
  // SPOKEN token is ~560ms (see groq.service.js) — there the hedge should never

  //
  // The "one continuous stream" part is load-bearing. An earlier attempt
  // synthesized each sentence as a SEPARATE MP3 and appended them to a single
  // MediaSource; independent MP3s don't share frame alignment, so the decoder
  // lost sync at every boundary and played fluent non-language noise. Per-
  // segment playback (see streamTtsForText) fixed that for the HTTP path, and
  // this path sidesteps it entirely by never producing a second file.
  //
  // Which providers can do it is a capability lookup, not a hardcoded name —
  // ElevenLabs and Fish Audio today; anything else falls to the split path.

  // WHICH PATH THIS AGENT USES IS THE AGENT'S SETTING, NOT A DEPLOY FLAG.
